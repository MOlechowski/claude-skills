# Warranty and Statutory Warranty — Guide

Loaded on demand (Level 3), when warranty analysis or B2B aspects are needed.

## Two Protection Mechanisms

Under Polish law, buyers have **two independent** protection mechanisms:

| Mechanism | Legal Basis | Mandatory? | Who Is Liable |
|-----------|------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Rękojmia** (Statutory Warranty) | Civil Code Art. 556-576 | YES (for consumers) | Seller |
| **Gwarancja** (Voluntary Warranty) | Civil Code Art. 577-581 | NO (voluntary) | Guarantor (manufacturer, distributor, or seller) |

## Rękojmia (Statutory Warranty)

### For Consumers (B2C)

- **Duration:** 24 months from purchase date
- **Mandatory:** YES — seller cannot exclude it
- **Liable party:** seller (the shop where the product was bought)
- **Scope:** physical and legal defects of goods

### For Businesses (B2B)

- **Can be excluded:** YES — per Art. 558 of the Civil Code
- **Typical situation:** Most shops exclude statutory warranty for businesses in their terms of service
- **How to check:** Search the shop's terms of service for:
  - "wyłączenie rękojmi" (exclusion of statutory warranty)
  - "Art. 558"
  - "przedsiębiorca" (entrepreneur/business)
  - "prowadzący działalność gospodarczą" (conducting business activity)
  - "rękojmia nie przysługuje" (statutory warranty does not apply)

### Consequences for B2B

When statutory warranty is excluded, **the only protection is the voluntary warranty**. Therefore:
- Manufacturer warranty is critical for B2B purchases
- Seller warranty is risky (disappears if the shop closes)
- No warranty = no protection at all

## Gwarancja (Voluntary Warranty) — Types

### Warranty Type Hierarchy

```
Manufacturer warranty > Distributor warranty > Seller warranty
```

### Manufacturer Warranty

- **Guarantor:** equipment manufacturer (e.g., Yealink, Dell, MikroTik)
- **Service:** authorized service center or manufacturer/importer RMA center
- **Advantages:**
  - Works independently of the shop (shop may close down)
  - Manufacturer-level service (original parts)
  - Often longer than seller warranty
- **How to identify:**
  - "Typ gwarancji: Producenta" (Warranty type: Manufacturer)
  - "Gwarant: [manufacturer name]" (Guarantor: [manufacturer name])
  - "Serwis: [authorized service center]" (Service: [authorized service center])

### Distributor Warranty

- **Guarantor:** official distributor/importer (e.g., KONTEL for Yealink)
- **Service:** distributor's service center
- **Advantages:**
  - Local service in Polish language
  - Distributor tends to be more stable than a small shop
- **How to identify:**
  - "Gwarancja dystrybutora" (Distributor warranty)
  - Distributor name listed as guarantor

### Seller Warranty

- **Guarantor:** the shop where the product was bought (e.g., x-kom sp. z o.o.)
- **Service:** shop's service department
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Disappears if the shop closes down
  - Shop may have limited repair capabilities
  - For B2B: after losing statutory warranty + shop bankruptcy = zero protection
- **How to identify:**
  - "Gwarantem jest [shop name]" (Guarantor is [shop name])
  - "Gwarancja: [shop name] sp. z o.o." (Warranty: [shop name])
  - No mention of manufacturer in warranty terms

## Warranty Verification Checklist (per shop)

For each shop, perform:

1. [ ] Open product page → look for "Gwarancja" (Warranty) section
2. [ ] Check who the guarantor is (manufacturer / distributor / shop)
3. [ ] Check warranty duration
4. [ ] Check terms of service → search for "rękojmia" and "Art. 558"
5. [ ] If Allegro → check seller profile (authorized distributor?)
6. [ ] Label type: YES (manufacturer) / NO (seller) / ? (unknown)

## Grey Market Indicators

Products sold outside the official distribution chain.

### Red Flags

| Indicator | What It Means |
|----------|--------------|
| Seller warranty instead of manufacturer | Product may not be from official distribution |
| Price anomaly (>>15% cheaper than market) | Suspicious origin |
| Not on manufacturer's authorized seller list | Unofficial channel |
| "Import prywatny" or "parallel import" | Product from another market |
| Manual only in foreign language | Import from abroad |
| Short warranty (12 months instead of 24) | Global policy instead of local |

### How to Verify Authenticity

1. Check manufacturer website → list of authorized partners
2. Check PL distributor → list of authorized resellers
3. Contact service center → will they service a product bought from this shop

## Manufacturer vs Distributor — Warranty

Manufacturers often provide different warranty periods globally than local distributors:

| Scenario | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Manufacturer: 12 mo., PL Distributor: 24 mo. | Yealink DECT (12 global, KONTEL gives 24) |
| Manufacturer: 36 mo., Shop: 24 mo. | Manufacturer gives more than shop claims |
| Manufacturer: 24 mo., Shop: 12 mo. | Shop shortens — check warranty card |

**Rule:** Always check both the manufacturer policy AND the PL distributor policy.
The more favorable one applies (unless the warranty card states otherwise).
