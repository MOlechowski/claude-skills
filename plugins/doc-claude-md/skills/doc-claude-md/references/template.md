# AGENTS.md Template

This template defines the structure for generated AGENTS.md files. Sections marked with `[conditional]` are included only when relevant.

## Template Structure

```yaml
---
last_validated: {ISO-8601 timestamp}
project_type: {detected type}
---
```

## Sections

### 1. Repository Overview (required)

Brief description of the project. Auto-extracted from:
- README.md first paragraph
- package.json description
- pyproject.toml description

### 2. Repository Structure (required)

Directory tree generated by the cli-tree skill. Default depth: 3 levels.

```
project/
├── src/
├── tests/
└── package.json
```

### 3. Skills Framework [conditional]

Included only if `.claude/skills/` directory exists. Describes the skills framework and progressive disclosure.

### 4. Development Guidelines (required)

Code style and development practices. Default content:

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Write clear, self-documenting code

### 5. Available Commands [conditional]

Included only if package.json scripts exist. Lists available npm commands extracted from package.json.

### 6. Testing (required)

Testing instructions based on project type:
- Node.js: `npm test`
- Python: `pytest`
- Rust: `cargo test`
- Go: `go test ./...`

### 7. Git Workflow (required)

Standard git workflow:
1. Check status
2. Create feature branch
3. Make changes and commit
4. Push and create PR

## Project Type Detection

| Type | Detection Method |
|------|------------------|
| `nodejs-next` | package.json with next dependency |
| `nodejs-react` | package.json with react dependency |
| `nodejs-api` | package.json with express/fastify/koa |
| `nodejs-library` | package.json (other) |
| `python` | pyproject.toml or setup.py |
| `rust` | Cargo.toml |
| `go` | go.mod |
| `monorepo` | Multiple package.json in packages/ |
| `unknown` | No recognized project files |

## Customization

After generation, customize the AGENTS.md:

1. Add project-specific guidelines
2. Document architecture decisions
3. Add common commands or workflows
4. Include troubleshooting tips

The `last_validated` timestamp tracks when docs were last verified against the codebase.
